### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**ATAR-Resource-Dumpster/ATAR-Resource-Dumpster** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

### This server serves as a public archive of past ATAR resources to study for WACE.
### Obviously, I can't store everything here, but I'll do what I can.
